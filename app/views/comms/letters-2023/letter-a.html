                  <p>
                    Thank you for claiming Maternity Allowance.

                  </p>

                    <p>You need to report changes in your circumstances that happen while you’re getting Maternity Allowance, for example if you go back to work. </p>
                    <p>To learn more about the changes you need to report, visit <b> www.gov.uk/report-benefits-change-circumstances. </b></p>
                    <p>Your Maternity Allowance could be stopped or reduced if you do not report a change straight away. If you’re paid too much you might have to pay some of the money back. 
                    <p>Deliberately not reporting changes is benefit fraud and you may face action. </p>

                    <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">If you disagree with a decision </h4>
                    <p><b>You can ask us to explain why </b><br>
                    You, or someone who has the authority to act for you, can phone or write to us within one month of the date on this letter to ask us to explain our decision in writing. </p>
                       
                    <p><b>You can also ask us to reconsider a decision </b><br>
                      Tell us if you have more information, or if you think we have overlooked something which might change the decision. Do this within one month of the date on this letter. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>We will look at what you tell us and send you a letter to tell you what we have decided, and why. We call this letter a Mandatory Reconsideration Notice. </p>
                      
                      <p><b>When you have done this you can appeal </b><br>
                      If you disagree with the Mandatory Reconsideration Notice, you can appeal to a tribunal. </p> 
                      <p>You must wait for the Mandatory Reconsideration Notice before you start an appeal. </p>
